> Focus: Codebase refactor — Phases 0-2

## What Got Done

- **Deep refactor analysis:** 3 parallel subagents analyzed all JS modules, HTML, CSS, and docs
- **Pre-mortem review:** Identified risks in the plan (closure state in createCelestialBody, slider debounce nuance, accessibility scope creep). Adjusted execution order accordingly.

### Phase 0 — Quick Wins
- Deleted `animationFrameCounter` dead code (main.js)
- Extracted 3 repeated inline divider styles into `.section-separator` CSS class
- Moved hardcoded button colors from JS (`#28a745`/`#007bff`) to CSS `.btn-paused` class
- Added 5 new CSS tokens (`--amber-bright`, `--caution-text`, `--caution-text-hover`, `--bg-dark`, `--bg-dropdown`), replaced 9 hardcoded color values
- Cleaned up misleading "TESTING" comment in physics.js
- Created `createMaterialPropertyHandler()` factory for roughness/metalness sliders

### Phase 1 — Physics Cleanup
- Extracted `calculateRotationMatrix()` helper — eliminated verbatim duplication between `updateCelestialBody()` and `addOrbitPath()`
- Pre-allocated `_tempVec3`, `_tempVec3b`, `_rotMatrix` — eliminated per-frame Vector3 allocations in render loop
- Moon transformation reuses pre-allocated vectors

### Phase 2 — Config Consolidation
- Created `VISUAL_CONFIG` in `celestialBodyData.js` (bloom, audio, bodySize, geometry segments, camera, lighting)
- Replaced magic numbers across main.js and threeSetup.js with config references

### Verification
- Playwright screenshots taken after each phase — all visually identical to baseline
- Zero console errors across all phases

## Files Changed

- `main.js` — dead code removal, VISUAL_CONFIG imports, bloom/audio/geometry config refs
- `physics.js` — rotation matrix helper, pre-allocated vectors, cleaned TESTING comment
- `uiControls.js` — material slider factory, button color class toggle
- `celestialBodyData.js` — added VISUAL_CONFIG export
- `threeSetup.js` — VISUAL_CONFIG imports for camera/lighting/starfield
- `style.css` — 5 new tokens, replaced 9 hardcoded values, added `.section-separator` and `.btn-paused`
- `solarsystem.html` — replaced 3 inline style blocks with `.section-separator` class
- `docs/lessons.md` — first lessons captured

## What's Next

### Phase 3 — Split createCelestialBody + Unify Rings (biggest structural change)
1. Inventory closure variables in `createCelestialBody` — design state-passing strategy
2. Extract texture/gradient utilities (`createGradientTexture(config)`)
3. Unify ring creation into single `createRingSystem(config)`
4. Split into `createStar()`, `createPlanet()`, `createMoon()`, `createAsteroid()` builders

### Phase 4 — Split setFocus
- Extract `populateSettingsPanel()` from camera animation logic

### Phase 5 — Size Slider Optimization
- Test `scale.set()` approach vs. geometry recreation
- Implement throttle or transform-based scaling

### Deferred
- T5: ARIA attributes and keyboard navigation (needs its own design session)
- T6: Responsive breakpoints (needs UI architecture rethink for mobile)

## Blockers

- None

## Notes

- Playwright baseline screenshot at `screenshots/baseline-before-refactor.png`
- Phase screenshots at `screenshots/after-phase{0,1,2}-*.png`
- CLAUDE.md needs minor updates (inline styles gotcha is now stale, VISUAL_CONFIG should be documented) — suggested changes were presented but not applied, pending user approval
- Remaining ticket seeds and findings are documented in the session handoff "What's Next" section above
