- **Customizable:** Offer users options to customize the appearance and information display of celestial bodies.
- **Extensible:** Build a foundation that can be expanded with more celestial objects, features, and visual enhancements.
- **Performant:** Strive for smooth rendering and interaction within a web browser environment.

### 3. Target Audience

- Students (K-12, early college) learning about astronomy and space science.
- Educators looking for visual aids for teaching about the solar system.
- Space enthusiasts and hobbyist astronomers.
- General public interested in an interactive exploration of space.

  - Global settings (e.g., toggle all orbit paths, toggle all labels).
  - Search functionality for celestial bodies.
  - "Save/Load Scene State" for user customizations.
- **7.4 Visual Effects:**

- **7.7 Sound:**
  - Ambient space sounds or thematic music (optional).
- **7.8 Mobile Responsiveness:**

### 8. Success Metrics

- **User Engagement:** Time spent using the simulation.
- **Educational Impact:** (If measurable, e.g., via feedback) Improved understanding of solar system concepts.
- **Feature Adoption:** Use of interactive controls and customization options.
- **Performance:** Smooth frame rates across target browsers.
- **Stability:** Low number of bugs or rendering issues.

### 9. Open Issues / Questions (As of Version 1.0)

- **Texture URL Stability:** Reliance on external URLs for textures can be fragile. A more robust solution might involve hosting textures or providing a default set.
- **Performance at Scale:** Adding significantly more objects (e.g., thousands more asteroids, detailed Kuiper Belt) will require careful performance optimization.
- **Advanced Shadowing:** Current shadow system is good but could be enhanced for softer, more realistic penumbras, especially for moon shadows on planets (complex).
