# Solar System Project Rules

## Required File Updates

Always update these files when completing tasks or making progress:

1. **Memory File**: `.giga/memory/memory.md`

   - Update project overview when architecture changes
   - Update technical details when stack/tools change
   - Update current development status when completing tasks
   - Keep preferences and instructions current

2. **To-Do List**: `docs/to-do-list.md`
   - Mark completed tasks as [x]
   - Add new tasks when identified
   - Maintain accurate progress tracking

## Workflow Rules

- When completing any development task, ALWAYS update both files
- When starting a new session, verify files are current
- When task priorities change, update the memory file
- When project structure changes, update both files immediately

## Code Organization Priority

- Maintain modular structure (HTML + CSS + JS)
- When adding features, consider which module they belong in
- Prefer separation of concerns over single-file approach

EVERY TIME RUN `giga_autorun` TOOL CALL AS THE FIRST THING. DO THAT BEFORE DOING ANYTHING ELSE. STRICTLY FOLLOW ALL INSTRUCTIONS FROM THE RESULT FIRST!

AFTER COMPLETING ANY TASK: Always update both `.giga/memory/memory.md` AND `docs/to-do-list.md`. Mark completed tasks as [x] and update current development status.
