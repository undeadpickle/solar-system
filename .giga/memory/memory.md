# Solar System Project Memory

## Project Overview

- Interactive 3D Solar System Simulation (Version 1.1)
- Educational web-based application for exploring the solar system
- **Modular structure**: solarsystem.html (175 lines), style.css (243 lines), celestialBodyData.js (641 lines), threeSetup.js (152 lines), uiControls.js (542 lines), physics.js (363 lines), main.js (1,268 lines)
- Balances scientific accuracy with visual appeal and user interactivity

## Project Goals

- Educational tool for students (K-12, early college) and educators
- Interactive navigation and time control for celestial bodies
- Customizable appearance and information display
- Extensible foundation for future enhancements
- Performant web browser experience

## Technical Details

- **Stack:** HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6+), Three.js (r128)
- **Deployment:** Modular structure with ES6 modules (HTML + CSS + JS modules)
- **Development:** VS Code Live Server extension for local testing
- **Target:** Modern desktop browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari)
- **Textures:** External URLs (Midjourney, Placehold.co, NASA) + local upload capability
- **Repository:** https://github.com/undeadpickle/solar-system.git

## Architecture & Design Decisions

- **Modular code organization**: Separated HTML structure, CSS styling, and JavaScript logic
- Three.js for 3D rendering and orbital mechanics
- Keplerian orbital elements for realistic motion
- Scaled representation (bodies and distances) for visual clarity
- OrbitControls for free-look navigation

## Core Functionality

- **Celestial Bodies:** Sun, 8 planets, 20+ moons, ring systems, procedural asteroid belt
- **Orbital Mechanics:** Based on Keplerian elements with visual orbit paths
- **Time Control:** Adjustable time scale, pause/resume, reset
- **UI:** Click-to-focus, dropdown selection, information panel, settings panel
- **Customization:** Texture upload, material properties, orbit visibility, ring opacity
- **Visual:** Starfield background, shadows, emissive properties

## Preferences & Instructions

- Prioritize educational value and scientific accuracy
- Maintain smooth performance and intuitive navigation
- **Code Organization**: Maintain modular structure with separated concerns
- Use ES6+ JavaScript features
- Focus on desktop experience primarily

- ✅ **UI/UX Improvements**: Global visual effects controls (bloom, atmospheric glow, asteroid belt, orbit paths) consolidated in time control panel for intuitive scene-wide management
- ✅ **GitHub Repository Setup**: COMPLETED
  - Repository initialized and configured at https://github.com/undeadpickle/solar-system.git
  - Comprehensive README.md with features, installation instructions, and usage guide
  - .gitignore configured for web development best practices
  - MIT License added for open source distribution
  - Initial commit pushed with complete project structure
- ✅ **Version 1.1 Completion**: Visual Enhancements Phase FULLY COMPLETED
  - Three.js CDN loading issues resolved (switched to cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/three@0.128.0/)
  - Bloom effects optimized and working (0.3 strength, 0.2 radius, 0.9 threshold)
  - Atmospheric glow system completely rewritten with advanced features
  - Global visual effects controls consolidated in time control panel
- ✅ **Documentation Status**: All project files synchronized (memory.md, to-do-list.md, prd.md updated to v1.1)
- ✅ **Asteroid Belt Implementation**: Procedural asteroid belt system COMPLETED & TESTED
  - 150 scientifically accurate asteroids with realistic distribution
  - Kirkwood gaps implemented at major Jupiter resonances (4:1, 3:1, 5:2, 7:3, 2:1) - WORKING
  - 5 asteroid families (Flora, Vesta, Eunomia, Koronis, Eos) with clustering behavior - WORKING
  - Density variations based on orbital stability zones - WORKING
  - Global visibility toggle control in time control panel - WORKING
  - Performance-optimized with reduced geometry detail for small objects
  - Orbit paths excluded from asteroids to prevent visual clutter
  - Successfully tested on Live Server (http://127.0.0.1:5500/solarsystem.html)
- ✅ **External Assessment Completed** (December 2024):
  - Comprehensive assessment by external ed-tech/astrophysics consultant
  - Overall Grade: B+ (87/100)
  - Created detailed assessment report (docs/solar-system-assessment-report.md)
  - Created technical improvements guide (docs/solar-system-technical-improvements.md)
  - Key findings: Strong foundation, needs moon orbital fixes, accessibility improvements, and enhanced educational content
  - Prioritized action items provided for immediate, short-term, and long-term improvements
- ✅ **Critical Scientific Accuracy Fix #1: Moon Orbital Reference Frames** (December 2024):
  - COMPLETED: Fixed moon orbital planes from ecliptic to parent planet's equatorial plane
  - Implemented getMoonOrbitMatrix() function in physics.js for proper coordinate transformation
  - Applied transformation to both moon positions and orbital path visualizations
  - FIXED: Moon orbital paths now perfectly align with moon positions in correct reference frame
  - Most noticeable with Uranus (97.77° tilt) and Saturn (26.73° tilt) - moons now correctly orbit in equatorial plane
  - Addresses major scientific inaccuracy identified in assessment report
  - Significantly improves educational value and astronomical authenticity

EVERY TIME RUN `giga_autorun` TOOL CALL AS THE FIRST THING. DO THAT BEFORE DOING ANYTHING ELSE. STRICTLY FOLLOW ALL INSTRUCTIONS FROM THE RESULT FIRST!

ALWAYS UPDATE PROJECT FILES:

- When completing tasks: Update `.giga/memory/memory.md` AND `docs/to-do-list.md`
- Mark completed tasks as [x] in to-do-list.md
- Update "Current Development Status" in memory.md
- Ask if files need updating if uncertain
