# Solar System Project Memory

## Project Overview

- Interactive 3D Solar System Simulation (Version 1.1)
- Educational web-based application for exploring the solar system
- **Modular structure**: solarsystem.html (175 lines), style.css (243 lines), celestialBodyData.js (641 lines), threeSetup.js (196 lines), uiControls.js (542 lines), physics.js (363 lines), main.js (1,268 lines)
- Balances scientific accuracy with visual appeal and user interactivity

## Project Goals

- Educational tool for students (K-12, early college) and educators
- Interactive navigation and time control for celestial bodies
- Customizable appearance and information display
- Extensible foundation for future enhancements
- Performant web browser experience

## Technical Details

- **Stack:** HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6+), Three.js (r128)
- **Deployment:** Modular structure with ES6 modules (HTML + CSS + JS modules)
- **Development:** Cursor IDE with Live Server extension for local testing (required for ES6 modules)
- **Testing URL:** http://127.0.0.1:5500/solarsystem.html (Live Server required due to CORS restrictions)
- **Target:** Modern desktop browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari)
- **Textures:** External URLs (Midjourney, Placehold.co, NASA) + local upload capability
- **Repository:** https://github.com/undeadpickle/solar-system.git

## Architecture & Design Decisions

- **Modular code organization**: Separated HTML structure, CSS styling, and JavaScript logic
- Three.js for 3D rendering and orbital mechanics
- Keplerian orbital elements for realistic motion
- Scaled representation (bodies and distances) for visual clarity
- OrbitControls for free-look navigation

## Core Functionality

- **Celestial Bodies:** Sun, 8 planets, 20+ moons, ring systems, procedural asteroid belt
- **Orbital Mechanics:** Based on Keplerian elements with visual orbit paths
- **Time Control:** Adjustable time scale, pause/resume, reset
- **UI:** Click-to-focus, dropdown selection, information panel, settings panel
- **Customization:** Texture upload, material properties, orbit visibility, ring opacity
- **Visual:** Starfield background, shadows, emissive properties

## Preferences & Instructions

- Prioritize educational value and scientific accuracy
- Maintain smooth performance and intuitive navigation
- **Code Organization**: Maintain modular structure with separated concerns
- Use ES6+ JavaScript features
- Focus on desktop experience primarily
- **Development Workflow**: ALWAYS use Cursor Live Server extension for testing (ES6 modules require HTTP server, not file:// protocol)

EVERY TIME RUN `giga_autorun` TOOL CALL AS THE FIRST THING. DO THAT BEFORE DOING ANYTHING ELSE. STRICTLY FOLLOW ALL INSTRUCTIONS FROM THE RESULT FIRST!

ALWAYS UPDATE PROJECT FILES:

- When completing tasks: Update `.giga/memory/memory.md` AND `docs/to-do-list.md`
- Mark completed tasks as [x] in to-do-list.md
- Update "Current Development Status" in memory.md
- Ask if files need updating if uncertain
